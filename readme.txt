Inspired in a roundabout way by @professor's talk at WordCamp Boston- particularly using shortcodes to identify conditional content. I've had clients who were very confused by shortcodes, and I wonder if a plugin like this would help. Very simple, zero configuration, just creates a WYSIWYG button.

This still needs to be tested outside of my development environment, so your mileage may vary.
